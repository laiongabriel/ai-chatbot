## Magnificent Technologies 💻

### Backend - Express.js Royalty:

To keep those pesky API keys hidden from the prying eyes of the front-end, I've employed the regal Express.js framework. It creates a majestic endpoint, requests the data, and bestows it upon the front-end with grace. And because I'm feeling generous, you get a whole 15 messages per day!

### Frontend - The Holy Trinity:

This interface and layout were handcrafted by me, using the divine combination of HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Bask in its glory!
