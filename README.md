## Technologies

### Backend:

In order not to show the API key on the front-end, the connection is established through an endpoint created with the Express.js framework, which makes the request and returns the data to the front-end. There is a limitation of 15 messages per day for each user.

### Frontend:

This interface and layout was made from scratch by me using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
